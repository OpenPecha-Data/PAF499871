Brief Light Offering Prayer
by Khenpo Pema Vajra

namkhé tartuk shying kham rabjam na
In all the infinite realms throughout the far reaches of the universe,
könchok rinchen nam sum ten dang ché
May the precious Three Jewels together with their representations,
sönam sakpé shying chok shyuk so tsal
Be present as a supreme field for the accumulation of merit—
malü dé dak kun gyi chenlam du
Before you all, in your very presence,
nang sal marmé chöpa di bulwé
I make this offering of a lamp of brilliant light:
dak dang tayé semchen tamché kyi
Through this, for me and all other beings, infinite in number,
ma rik timuk münpa kun sel né
May the darkness of ignorance and delusion be banished entirely,
künkhyen yeshe nangwa tongwar shok
So that we may behold the light of omniscient wisdom!

This brief light offering prayer was written by Pema Vajra.
